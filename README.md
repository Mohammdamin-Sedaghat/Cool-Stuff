# Side Projects

Here are the projects I make in my free time. (~~other than the racket folder, thats just assignments~~) 

I think there are a few good ones in here like the

- [Amazon Clone](https://github.com/Mohammdamin-Sedaghat/Cool-Stuff/tree/main/Amazon): a replicate of Amazon.
- [Christmas Postcard](https://github.com/Mohammdamin-Sedaghat/Cool-Stuff/tree/main/Chirstmas%20Postcard): Copy the code, and u'll see a cool postcard
- [Canvas_cool_stuff](https://github.com/Mohammdamin-Sedaghat/Cool-Stuff/tree/main/Canvas%20cool%20stuff): I was messing around here before my [Snake Futuristica]() Project to see what is possible with the Canvas API. I think the best directory is this one because... well Game Development is cool ðŸ†’ðŸ˜Ž
- Many More! 

Before you dive deep, I suggest wearing a helmet so you don't explode your head from all the stuff here!
