# Side Projects

Here are some of the smaller side projects that I've done. 

Here is the breakdown of individual Projects:
1. **Gregorian-calender** This program, developed in Racket, calculates the day of the week based on any given date. It's a simple yet powerful tool to demonstrate calendar algorithms in functional programming.

2. **Diversity-Toronto** This interactive program highlights the rich cultural mosaic of Toronto. As a visitor in the game, you embark on a journey through the city's vibrant neighborhoods, collecting souvenirs and learning about diverse cultures while overcoming unique challenges. It’s a fun way to explore cultural diversity and geography within the city.

3. **Chirstmas Postcard** Created with Python’s Pygame library, this postcard demonstrates how simple code can bring beautiful scenes to life. It showcases how Python can be used to design visually appealing and interactive experiences.

4. **War** is a card game. You can see the rules here: [wikipedia.org/War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)).

5. **Black Jack** is also another famous card game. You will be playing against a computer. Here is the link to the article explaining the game: [wikipedia.org/Black-jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack).

6. **Area Overlap Calculator** This exercise, implemented in Racket, was a rewarding challenge. The task is to calculate the overlapping area between two rectangles defined by the following structure:
```
(define-struct box (xmin xmax ymin ymax))
;;A Box is a (make-box Num Num Num Num)
;;Recquires:
;;   xmax >= xmin
;;   ymax >= ymin
```
Before diving into the code, I encourage you to attempt solving the problem yourself!
