# Side Projects

Here are some of the smaller side projects that I've done. 

Here is the breakdown of individual Projects:
1. **Gregorian-calender** This program, developed in Racket, calculates the day of the week based on any given date. It's a simple yet powerful tool to demonstrate calendar algorithms in functional programming.
2. **Diversity-Toronto** This interactive program highlights the rich cultural mosaic of Toronto. As a visitor in the game, you embark on a journey through the city's vibrant neighborhoods, collecting souvenirs and learning about diverse cultures while overcoming unique challenges. It’s a fun way to explore cultural diversity and geography within the city.
3. **Chirstmas Postcard** Created with Python’s Pygame library, this postcard demonstrates how simple code can bring beautiful scenes to life. It showcases how Python can be used to design visually appealing and interactive experiences.
